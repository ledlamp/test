**Mover:** 「Thank you very much! I'm heading out now!」
**Kashou:** 「... Phew, this should be most of the boxes then.」
I wiped the sweat off my forehead with my arm...
... as the moving truck disappeared from view.
Although it was early April and only the beginning of spring...
... today's weather was quite nice. It was even a bit hot.
**Kashou:** 「Well, it's a good day for a new start.」
I turned my head to look at the empty bakery which didn't even have any signage yet.
The brand-new exterior wall had a Western look with a predominantly white and brown motif.
There was also a large window which let lots of sunlight in.
And finally, there were the words that displayed the name of the bakery: "La Soleil".
Instead of the proper French article, "Le", it was "La Soleil", meaning "The Sun".
This was a nod towards the name of the shop of someone I admired.
**Kashou:** 「... Now that I'm on my own, I'll have to do my best.」
I softly murmured to myself.
From here on out, no one would tell me what to do.
I was going to start completely anew despite the stature of my family's name and everything that had happened up until now.
I alone would decide my path and take responsibility for what I do.
In exchange for that freedom, I can't blame anyone else for what happens.
Still...
Although I was a bit worried...
... the thought of what lay ahead made me break into a smile.
**Kashou:** 「... All right.」
**Kashou:** 「In any case, I'd better get all these things cleaned up.」
I took a deep breath and got my spirits back up.
I stepped into the new-smelling bakery.
**Kashou:** 「... Hmm? What's with this big box...?」
In front of me was a large box I didn't recognize.
In fact, there were two of them.
"Fragile!" "Delicate!"
"Absolutely this side up!" "If thrown, your company will be in trouble!"
The warnings were going overboard. They were getting annoying.
**Kashou:** 「Even if these are baking supplies, I don't remember buying anything quite like this...」
First off, they were boxes that looked like they came from my house.
If these were for the bakery, there's no way I wouldn't remember buying them.
There were no tags from the moving company either.
All there was were those warning labels.
**Kashou:** 「... Well, I'll know for sure once I open the--」
**Box:** 「Achoo!!」
**Kashou:** 「Huh...?!」
**Box:** 「......」
**Kashou:** 「......」
**Box:** 「M-Me\~ow...?」
**Kashou:** 「......」
**Box:** 「......」
**Kashou:** 「Oh, it's just a cat, huh? Just a troublesome cat. Geez.」
**Box:** 「Phew... thank goodness. Looks like that fooled him...」
**Box:** 「That was close... Chocola'd better be careful, meow...」
**Kashou:** 「Like that would fool me! What are you doing, Chocola?!」
**Chocola:** 「Eheheh... uhm, l-long time no see... right, Master...?」
**Kashou:** 「We just saw each other at home yesterday, you know.」
**Chocola:** 「Well, uhm... that is true, Chocola guesses... Ahaha...」
**Chocola:** 「Ah, more importantly than that, listen up! Those movers were really mean!」
**Chocola:** 「So they were picking up Chocola, right?!」
**Chocola:** 「And they said "This box is heavy, so be careful with it!"」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola wanted to hiss at them all of a sudden. Chocola really did!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola did her best to control her temper, but Chocola was fuming, you know! Absolutely fuming!」
**Kashou:** 「Well, compared to the rest of my things, you are heavy...」
She ignored what I said.
Chocola puffed out her cheeks.
You could say that she was always happy-go-lucky.
Or rather she preoccupied herself with only what was in front of her.
... Well, I guess that was how you'd describe Chocola.
**Kashou:** 「While I was getting ready to move, I did wonder why I didn't see you--」
**Box2:** 「Achee!!」
**Box2:** 「Hmmm...」
**Kashou:** 「... Hey.」
**Vanilla:** 「Long time no see, Master.」
**Vanilla:** 「My nose was itchy because the inside of the moving truck was dusty.」
**Kashou:** 「Why is Vanilla here too...」
**Vanilla:** 「Wherever Chocola is, I am too.」
**Vanilla:** 「Besides, catgirls don't dislike tight spaces.」
**Vanilla:** 「Also, they said "This box is heavy, so be careful with it" in regards to me too.」
**Vanilla:** 「So I was also mad. Just steaming!」
**Kashou:** 「Again, huh?」
**Kashou:** 「In any case, Chocola, Vanilla, get out of there.」
I was at my wits' end with the large boxes that had suddenly shown up.
Anyhow, Chocola and Vanilla got out of their boxes.
**Kashou:** 「... Why is no one picking up the phone?」
**Kashou:** 「Just what is Shigure doing...?」
I hung up after trying to call my little sister.
There was no way that Chocola and Vanilla could've gotten mixed in with the rest of the boxes in the first place.
On the outside, catgirls look almost like humans.
They can understand words and can talk just like us.
But more than humans, catgirls were closer to normal cats.
After all, catgirls had ears and tails just like cats do.
They were genetically modified humanoid cats that were commonly referred to as "catgirls."
These days, catgirls fit into society...
... as pets in families or partners to humans.
My little sister really loves to dote on catgirls...
... so our family has six including Chocola and Vanilla.
In any case, they couldn't have mailed themselves all on their own.
Mailing living things through the post would be impossible, for one thing.
There's no way my parents would have helped with this either.
Thus I could only guess that this was somehow Shigure's doing...
**Kashou:** 「... I see, so Shigure was an accomplice then.」
**Chocola:** 「Meow~! This is a really pretty home~ ♪」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola really likes the smell of mew bedding and furniture~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「It's bigger than it looks. Perfect for Master's abilities.」
**Chocola:** 「Vanilla, over here! Let's take a look at that room! Time to explore!」
**Vanilla:** 「From where it is, I suspect that it is a bedroom. Master's new bed must be there.」
**Chocola:** 「Meow! We can't miss that! Let's go snuggle in it! Snuggle time!」
**Vanilla:** 「Snuggling acknowledged. That is fine by me.」
**Vanilla:** 「With that decided, let's go~!」
**Kashou:** 「Don't get out of control and hurt yourselves!」
**Chocola:** 「Okay~! ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「Okay~!」
Without any ill intentions, the two catgirls were off and running.
Well, the bakery did have living quarters on the second floor...
... so I wasn't worried about them causing a ruckus around here.
Of course, they aren't young catgirls anymore either...
... so I shouldn't have to worry about them getting out of control too much.
**Kashou:** 「... Well, besides that...」
I looked up an address in my phone's address book.
*Minaduki Residence*
**Kashou:** 「... Well, I already left Shigure a message, so she should call me back later.」
Without pressing the call button, I put my cell phone back in my pocket.
I had moved out without saying anything...
... so for her to call me back within the day seemed a bit stupid.
Well, it wasn't really an issue I needed to bring up right this moment.
I should hear from Shigure soon anyhow.
**Chocola:** 「We've finished snuggling on Master's bed!」
**Vanilla:** 「The new bed is very fluffy. It gets a passing score.」
**Kashou:** 「Good work, you two.」
**Kashou:** 「Gosh, both of you have major bed-head. Sheesh!」
**Chocola:** 「Fuwah~ Chocola loves it when Master rubs her head~ ♪ It feels good~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「I have no objections to this. More.」
I tidied up their hair with a comb.
Their soft hair felt nice as always.
I lightly bonked them both on the head while they had their eyes closed.
**Kashou:** 「... Now then, why were the two of you hiding among my moving boxes?」
**Chocola:** 「... You said you wouldn't bring us with you so we had no choice.」
**Vanilla:** 「Chocola said she was going, so I tagged along.」
**Kashou:** 「You had no choice? Just tagged along? You two...」
Well, I figured that had to be the reason, but...
Anyhow, I recomposed myself and looked at the two of them again.
**Kashou:** 「Listen up, okay?」
**Kashou:** 「How many times have I told you two? This isn't a vacation or a picnic.」
**Kashou:** 「I moved out because I have no intention of going back there.」
**Kashou:** 「If you were at home, you wouldn't have anything to worry about. Shigure and the other catgirls are there too.」
**Kashou:** 「It would be better if you two just--」
**Chocola:** 「Th-That's not it! It's just that, uhmm...!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola's stomach is just being rebellious!! So that's not it, really!!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master moved out really early in the morning, so there was no time to eat breakfast.」
**Vanilla:** 「The sound of Chocola's stomach rumbling is cute anyways.」
While listening to those silly excuses, I glanced at the clock and saw that it was already past 1 o'clock.
Now that I thought about it, I haven't eaten anything since this morning either.
**Kashou:** 「Well... why don't we have lunch first then?」
**Chocola:** 「Yay~! Food! Chocola loves Master!」
**Vanilla:** 「Understanding as ever, Master. We are in your debt.」
These two were as easygoing as always.
**Chocola:** 「Shopping~ Shopping~ ♪」
**Chocola:** 「Shopping together with Master~ Meow~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「Lately, Master hasn't taken us shopping with him at all...」
**Vanilla:** 「... So that's why Chocola is in such a good mood right now. Meow~」
**Chocola:** 「You're really happy too, right Vanilla~? ♪」
**Chocola:** 「Come on, Chocola is going to squish your cheeks~」
**Vanilla:** 「Fueh! Chocola, that tickles...!」
**Vanilla:** 「Myah, myahn... Don't~ ♪」
**Kashou:** 「You'll bother those around us, so try not to get too carried away, you two.」
Since the refrigerator was empty, we headed to the nearby shopping district to buy groceries.
From brand-name clothing stores to supermarkets, there was an array of stores.
There was even a drug store with daily necessities amongst them.
*If you come here, we have just about everything.*
That was how the real estate agent had recommended this place to me.
**Kashou:** 「Wait, don't you two go shopping with Shigure often?」
**Chocola:** 「Uuuu~ Shopping with Shigure-chan and shopping with Master are totally different!」
**Vanilla:** 「Sigh~ It's troubling that Master doesn't have the proper mindset of a master. Chocola pities you.」
**Kashou:** 「Hey, first of all, Shigure is your master.」
**Chocola:** 「Shigure-chan is our master too, but Shigure-chan is Shigure-chan!」
**Chocola:** 「That's why Master is Master!」
**Chocola:** 「It's totally different, right? Right? Right?」
**Vanilla:** 「I don't understand your reasoning, but I can tell you're very enthusiastic. Just as expected of Chocola. Clap clap clap~」
**Kashou:** 「... Never mind then. Anyhow, keep it down inside the store, okay?」
I parted from the two of them.
I decided to hurry on ahead.
**Chocola:** 「Master! Shigure-chan said this is a good shampoo!」
**Vanilla:** 「It makes your hair all smooth and smells really sweet and nice too!」
**Kashou:** 「But that's stuff for you two to use.」
**Kashou:** 「I don't need it, so put it down and come over here.」
**Chocola:** 「Fuehh...! Master, that's mean...!」
**Chocola:** 「It's so mean, it feels like you hit me, fuehhh...!!」
**Vanilla:** 「Now now, don't cry, Chocola. Master is an awful person, isn't he?」
**Kashou:** 「Don't just say that and then toss that in the basket all nonchalantly.」
**Vanilla:** 「Tch, his defense is strong.」
I had to be on guard or they would sneak something in when I wasn't paying attention.
They even tried to grab another basket for themselves at the supermarket earlier.
It was apparent to me how dreadful an idea it was when they decided to come along.
**Chocola:** 「Eheheh~ ♪ Sorry, Master!」
**Chocola:** 「It's been a long time since Chocola went shopping with Master, so Chocola got really excited.」
**Vanilla:** 「Catgirls are honest, so it can't be helped.」
**Vanilla:** 「It would be nice if Master was honest too. Slip~」
**Kashou:** 「It has nothing to do with being honest. I'm telling you, don't just put the shampoo in the basket like that. Put it back.」
**Chocola:** 「We repent! Please, Master!」
**Chocola:** 「We beg of you! We beg of you to buy shampoo for Chocola and Vanilla!」
**Vanilla:** 「It's sad to return to a home that doesn't have shampoo. Catgirls don't like having oily hair.」
**Female Customer A:** 「He won't even buy shampoo for those catgirls? The poor things...」
**Female Customer B:** 「I wonder if we should report him for catgirl abuse...」
**Kashou:** 「Don't put on some act to confuse the customers around us! Seriously!」
We'd only just moved here...
... but suddenly, we already had disapproving glares directed at us.
**Chocola:** 「Going out with Master is lots of fun! ♪」
**Chocola:** 「It makes me want to start purring! Meow meow~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「He didn't buy us anything though. Master is such a cheapskate.」
**Kashou:** 「I'm not a cheapskate.」
**Kashou:** 「Besides, I nearly got reported.」
After that, it was the same sort of exchange at the supermarket.
The whole thing was so awkward that I don't think I can visit that shopping district for a while.
... Well, I guess you could say that was the cute side of catgirls.
**Vanilla:** 「Hmm? Sniff sniff, sniff sniff...」
**Vanilla:** 「Something smells really nice over there.」
**Chocola:** 「You're right! Something smells really good, Master!」
**Kashou:** 「It definitely does. What is this smell...」
I turned towards the source of it.
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Welcome~!」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Would you like to try some delicious, fresh takoyaki~?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Would you like to try some piping hot takoyaki with lots of bonito flakes on top~?」
**Chocola:** 「Wah, it's a takoyaki shop run by a catgirl! That's pretty rare, huh, Master?!」
**Vanilla:** 「Indeed. That little catgirl is cute.」
It was a catgirl younger than Chocola and Vanilla.
She waved her tiny hands as she politely drew customers in.
In human terms, she looked like she was about twelve or thirteen years old.
In cat years, she was about six months old.
The young catgirl noticed us and ran over.
**Food Stand Cat:** 「It's an older sister catgirl! Just like me, huh? Meow meow♪」
**Chocola:** 「Mmhmm, Chocola is the same as you~♪ Meow meow! ♪」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola is gonna rub your neck~ ♪ Rub rub~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「Young catgirls are so innocent and super cute. They're the best.」
**Vanilla:** 「I'll pat your head. Pat pat.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「I'm sorry that my catgirl is troubling you...」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Oh, are you the owner of those catgirls?」
The owner of the food stand greeted us.
**Kashou:** 「Yes, I am...」
**Kashou:** 「Ah well, to be more exact, my little sister is their owner.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「They're cute and smart catgirls, aren't they?」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「They're so courteous and well-spoken, too.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Mine is still only seven months old.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Maybe when she's a bit older, she'll be a fine catgirl like these two.」
The food stand owner had a wry smile on her face like she was talking about a mischievous child of hers.
At a glance, it was understandable that seeing a young catgirl made it easy to overlook these things.
**Kashou:** 「Mine were originally strays, so I don't actually know how old they are.」
**Kashou:** 「The veterinarian said that they were twins and were now about 9 months old.」
**Kashou:** 「My little sister is actually quite the education freak.」
**Kashou:** 「Back then they were really noisy, but it was all worth it.」
**Chocola:** 「Shigure-chan really taught us well!」
**Chocola:** 「She said we'd grow up to be good catgirls if we listened to her!」
**Vanilla:** 「Shigure was tough on us. But thanks to her, we learned a lot.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Really? What a wonderful owner you have.」
**Chocola:** 「Ah, but Master is Master!」
**Chocola:** 「And Shigure-chan is Shigure-chan! Right, Master?」
**Vanilla:** 「In other words, Shigure is an important friend.」
**Vanilla:** 「And when we say 'Master,' we are referring to Master over here.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Ahaha! You're a very well-loved "master," aren't you?」
**Kashou:** 「Well, I am grateful.」
She lightly nudged me with her elbow.
I responded with an embarrassed, forced smile.
... Hearing this kind of stuff in public sure was embarrassing.
**Chocola:** 「Little catgirl, why don't you look up a bit?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Up? Like this?」
**Vanilla:** 「An opening. Rub rub rub~ ♪」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Rub rub rub~♪」
The three of them were getting along very well.
The food stand owner looked fondly at them from nearby.
**Food Stand Owner:** 「... My catgirl was a stray, too.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「On a day just like this while I was selling takoyaki, she came up to me with an empty stomach.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「I took her home and she's been like a daughter to me.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「She's even able to help me with the shop now.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Humanoid cats were all the rage, but...」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「They're many times more difficult to take care of than regular cats.」
Her words seemed tinged with blame and worry.
She grumbled, letting out a sigh.
Not that long ago, it wasn't rare to see stray humanoid cats just wandering throughout town.
But now, it was more likely for one to see humanoid cats that were well loved by their owners.
Since the amount of unfortunate humanoid cats had decreased...
...there was more of a balance, and owners were quite elated.
**Food Stand Owner:** 「I really am disgusted with those who don't understand the responsibility involved in owning catgirls...」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「But then again, if it wasn't for them I'd have never found my cute daughter. Ahaha.」
It was a bright and honest laugh.
I nodded in agreement.
**Kashou:** 「... That is true.」
This must be like how pets find their way back to their owners.
I smiled at such an uncharacteristic thought from me.
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Ah, that's right!」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Older cat-sisters, would you like to try some takoyaki?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「It's piping hot, has a big piece of octopus in it, and is really, really tasty!」
**Chocola:** 「Really tasty takoyaki...!」
**Chocola:** 「Auuuu... but we're on our way home to have dinner...」
**Vanilla:** 「Yes, Master is going to cook for us, so... Sorry...」
Chocola and Vanilla's shoulders drooped downheartedly.
As they hung their heads, I rubbed them from behind.
I took a look at the little takoyaki seller.
**Kashou:** 「Okay, three orders of takoyaki. Can you do that for me?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Three orders?」
Her large eyes blinked as she tilted her head in confusion.
**Kashou:** 「Yeah. For me, Chocola, and Vanilla.」
**Kashou:** 「Could you do that for me?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Okay! Three orders, right?」
**Food Stand Cat:** 「Master, we've got an order! Three takoyaki!」
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「Master...!」
**Kashou:** 「It's going to take time to get home and make food, after all.」
**Kashou:** 「Besides, I want to try the takoyaki here, too.」
**Chocola:** 「Okay! Chocola's tummy is making big growly sounds too! Chocola is really happy!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master, you're so cool...!」
**Vanilla:** 「Shigure wasn't kidding when she said "a tsundere older brother is a good thing"...! 」
**Kashou:** 「Wait, what does that mean?」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Okay! Please choose the topping and flavour you'd like off this menu here.」
**Food Stand Owner:** 「Since you were so nice to my catgirl, I'll throw it in free of charge~ ♪」
**Chocola:** 「Wow~! Thank you so much!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola likes them with mayonnaise on top!」
**Vanilla:** 「Thank you so very much for your kindness. Bow~ I'd like mine to be fish roe and cheese flavour.」
My question was completely ignored.
... Well, I guess I shouldn't let it bother me, huh.
I wondered about that as I looked at Chocola and Vanilla...
... happily awaiting their takoyaki in front of the food stand.
**Kashou:** 「... I still can't get a hold of her.」
**Kashou:** 「Were there guests over today...?」
When I checked the clock, it was past 10 o'clock already.
Since then, I'd tried calling Shigure several times, but couldn't get through to her.
And just like that, it had already gotten this late.
**Kashou:** 「... I've never gone this long without hearing from Shigure.」
I really didn't understand my family's schedule at all...
**Chocola:** 「Master~? Master~?」
**Chocola:** 「It's been a while since we've bathed together! I'll even wash your back~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「You haven't bathed with us since we've matured. Master, you pervert.」
**Kashou:** 「You haven't even grown that much. What are you two talking about?」
**Chocola:** 「Me-Me-Meowhat did you just say?!」
**Chocola:** 「Shigure-chan said that Chocola and Vanilla have already grown to be elegant cat-ladies!」
**Vanilla:** 「Those words are sexual harassment. You are trampling on our dignity.」
**Vanilla:** 「Besides, this is Chocola's identity we are talking about.」
**Kashou:** 「Vanilla, you're the one changing the subject.」
**Kashou:** 「In any case, don't worry about the bath. You two need to get ready to go home.」
**Chocola:** 「Meow? Get ready to go home?」
**Chocola:** 「But isn't Chocola's home Master's home?」
**Vanilla:** 「And I belong next to Chocola.」
**Vanilla:** 「Also, Master is cool. You look strangely handsome.」
**Kashou:** 「Stop feigning ignorance, you two. Cut that out.」
The two of them looked my way, about to distract me again.
**Kashou:** 「Since Shigure isn't picking up, I'll take you two home.」
**Kashou:** 「So go get ready to leave.」
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「......」
Chocola and Vanilla turned away from me and cast their gazes downwards.
Returning home on the same day I had moved out...
... seemed to be such a stupid idea that I did hesitate a bit.
There was no other way.
Nor was there time for excuses.
I looked towards Chocola and Vanilla as they hung their heads in silence and continued on.
**Kashou:** 「Listen up, you two. I'm going to open my bakery.」
**Kashou:** 「I've got no one to rely on, so I don't know how things will turn out.」
**Kashou:** 「With all that's going on, I don't know if I can take care of you two. Get it?」
**Kashou:** 「I mean, it's already going to be difficult enough just looking after mysel--」
**Chocola:** 「...... No.」
It was a quiet voice I could barely hear.
Chocola said something with her head down.
**Kashou:** 「Hm? What did you say?」
I came closer and asked her to repeat herself.
**Chocola:** 「No way~! Chocola won't go back~!!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola hates Master for saying that~!!!」
**Kashou:** 「Uwah?! Ah wait! Hey, Chocola...?!」
**Vanilla:** 「I will also make great haste. Or rather, I'll withdraw with the speed of a catgirl.」
**Kashou:** 「Ah! Wait, stop!」
**Kashou:** 「Vanilla, why are you running away too?!」
**Chocola:** 「Come on, come on, Master~! Chocola's over here~」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola is over here, ahahahah~ ♪」
**Kashou:** 「It's dangerous, so stop running around! If you fall, you'll get hurt!」
**Vanilla:** 「It's unnecessary to worry about catgirls like that. Although we're humanoid, catgirls are cats. Dash dash~」
**Kashou:** 「Maybe so in Chocola's case, but aren't you bad with physical activity?!」
**Kashou:** 「Come on! I've got you now, Chocola!」
**Chocola:** 「Myaah! Master, you pervert!! Just where do you think you're grabbing?!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master is grabbing Chocola's chest with an iron grip.」
**Kashou:** 「I-I am not!! It's because you two are running around!」
**Chocola:** 「Meow, an opening!」
**Kashou:** 「Hey, ah, stop it! You're still going to run?!」
**Kashou:** 「Geh, I've got you, Vanilla!」
**Chocola:** 「Tickle tickle tickle tickle~ ♪」
**Kashou:** 「Wha--! Chocola, stop! Really, sto-- Gwahaha, chocowahah!」
**Vanilla:** 「Nice assist, Chocola. Go go!」
**Kashou:** 「Like I said, stop runningggg!!!」
The two of them didn't listen to a word I said as they continued to mess with me.
And that was how the first night went.
**Kashou:** 「For now I'll let you stay, but only for tonight...」
**Kashou:** 「I don't have guest beds or futons, okay?」
While all that was happening, 11 o' clock became midnight.
Even if I took them home, everyone was sure to be asleep by now.
The one glimmer of hope I had, that Shigure would call me back, didn't happen...
... so I decided that taking them home tomorrow was my first priority.
**Chocola:** 「Of course, we'll be sleeping in Master's bed~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「I will also be okay with Master's bed.」
... Cleverly, they had even brought pajamas.
Just how much planning went into their schemes, anyway...
**Kashou:** 「Really. If you two sleep there, where will I?」
**Chocola:** 「What?! You're not going to sleep together with us?! You tell us that this late?!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master is male, but he doesn't know when to give up. The sleeping arrangements should go Master→ Chocola→ Me.」
**Chocola:** 「Nyaha~ ♪ Being surrounded by Master and Vanilla makes Chocola happy~ ♪」
**Kashou:** 「Don't get ahead of yourself, you two.」
**Kashou:** 「A single bed for three people is too crowded.」
**Chocola:** 「Since we're the ones that are intruding, we're fine with here, too.」
**Chocola:** 「We can curl up and sleep like catgirls, after all.」
**Vanilla:** 「We are very praiseworthy for not asking for luxuries. We're model catgirls. We'll sleep like this then.」
I watched the two of them lie down and curl up...
... on the floor of an empty room, without even curtains.
**Kashou:** 「... That's way too pitiful of a sight to be called praiseworthy.」
**Chocola:** 「Since you just moved in, you have lots of boxes, right?」
**Vanilla:** 「Apparently, you can make a warm shelter out of them, so we'll manage somehow.」
**Kashou:** 「That's something only strange people would say.」
Where did these catgirls get this information from, anyways?
Well, they've probably read a lot of books and watched TV in Shigure's room.
Chocola isn't good with kanji characters, so she only reads picture books though.
**Kashou:** 「Ahh, whatever. You two go sleep in my bed.」
**Kashou:** 「It still gets pretty cold at night in April, after all.」
**Chocola:** 「Where is Master going to sleep then? Next to Chocola?」
**Kashou:** 「I'm going to sleep on the sofa in the living room.」
**Kashou:** 「The sofa can fit one person and there's air conditioning in there if I need it.」
**Chocola:** 「No! If that's the case, then Chocola will sleep on the sofa!」
**Chocola:** 「Please sleep in the bed with Vanilla, Master!」
**Vanilla:** 「I'm more relaxed on the sofa. It's better if Chocola and Master use the bed.」
They moved quickly towards me like lions catching their prey.
I placed my hands on their heads and spoke in a clear and stern voice.
**Kashou:** 「Listen up. I will sleep on the sofa and you two will sleep in my bed.」
**Kashou:** 「Those are your Master's orders. Understood?」
**Chocola:** 「Auuuuh... Master...」
**Vanilla:** 「Master...」
I said it like that deliberately.
The two of them looked as if they wanted to say something, but they hesitated.
They lowered their heads apologetically.
**Chocola:** 「... I'm sorry, Master.」
**Vanilla:** 「... Sorry, Master.」
... They mustered out. They looked like they were on the verge of tears.
Their obedience had the exact opposite of the effect I expected -- it filled me with guilt.
I felt a prickling sensation in my chest.
That pain left me as I sighed and rubbed the two of them on the head.
**Kashou:** 「Come on, get going.」
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「Okay...」
**Kashou:** 「Good night. If anything happens, call for me right away.」
**Chocola:** 「All right. Good night, Master.」
**Vanilla:** 「Good night, Master.」
I gently rubbed the heads of the two dispirited catgirls once more.
**Kashou:** 「See you in the morning.」
With that said, I turned the lights off in the room.
**Chocola:** 「... Master.」
**Chocola:** 「... Uhm, Chocola is really sorry. Chocola caused you so much trouble...」
Her vanishing voice echoed slightly in the darkened room.
The pain in my heart from before became even sharper.
I swallowed that pain and replied cheerfully.
**Kashou:** 「It's okay if it's just for one night. Don't worry about it.」
**Chocola:** 「Master...」
**Kashou:** 「Now then, go to sleep.」
**Kashou:** 「... I really shouldn't act on my emotions, huh?」
I laid down on the sofa.
I sighed while staring at the ceiling.
If I gave in to my emotions...
... the result would just lead to more sadness.
If I used kind or hopeful words...
... they would all end up as lies.
**Kashou:** 「... It's pretty uncool of me to be so passive like this.」
While I continued to pile on insults and make excuses for my actions...
... I closed my eyes and waited for sleep to take over.
**Shigure:** 「Regarding this situation, I want to respect Chocola and Vanilla's intentions.」
**Shigure:** 「If Chocola and Vanilla agree with it, then I'll come get them.」
... Was what she told me when I was finally able to get in touch with her.
Without any margin of negotiation space, I was struck down.
**Kashou:** 「But Shigure, even if you say that I don't think Chocola and Vanilla will...」
**Shigure:** 「By the way, Nii-sama. Would you whisper this morning's sweet nothings to your little sister?」
**Kashou:** 「Don't make it sound like it's a daily ritual or something.」
**Kashou:** 「In any case--」
**Shigure:** 「Ah, I'm sorry. Father is calling me, so I need to get going.」
**Shigure:** 「I love you, Nii-sama. I'll talk to you later.」
**Kashou:** 「Ah, wait! Shigure...!」
**Kashou:** 「... Seriously?」
As the ruthless electronic buzz of the dropped call echoed, I stared at my cell phone.
... And here I thought that I could sort all this out if I could just talk to Shigure.
**Chocola:** 「Munch munch munch, breakfast tastes good!」
**Chocola:** 「Master's breakfast always tastes good, meow~ ♪」
**Vanilla:** 「Chocola, there's some ketchup on your cheek.」
**Vanilla:** 「It's cutely artistic. I'll lick it off. Shlurp slurp~」
The catgirls in question were happily stuffing themselves with sandwiches.
These sandwiches incidentally contained tomato, cheese, and lettuce.
With an over-easy fried egg tucked inside all of that, it was a simple meal.
Breakfast was pretty much like this.
**Kashou:** 「You two are definitely going home today, okay?」
**Chocola:** 「Is it not fun having Chocola and Vanilla around, Master?」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola is a lot of fun, you know? With Chocola, it's a world-class level of fun!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master was really looking forward to it last night too.」
**Kashou:** 「Stop with the deliberately misleading words.」
I sighed at their happy-go-lucky mindset.
I took the opportunity to fill their empty glasses with milk.
The eating habits of catgirls were pretty much the same as those of humans, so that part was straightforward.
Of course, what they liked and disliked depended on each individual catgirl.
**Kashou:** 「In the end, I wasn't able to get everything put away yesterday.」
**Kashou:** 「Today, I really do have to start getting ready for the bakery's opening, too.」
**Kashou:** 「That's why I don't have time to relax and play with you two. Be good girls and go home.」
I said that to them with a sandwich in my hand.
**Chocola:** 「... Will Chocola being around cause problems for Master?」
She put her sandwich down on her plate...
... and just like yesterday, she looked at me with upturned eyes.
**Kashou:** 「Yeah, it's a problem.」
I answered her clearly.
**Chocola:** 「... I see... So that's how it really is...」
Her shoulders drooped more than before.
The ears which sat atop her head drooped downheartedly, too.
**Vanilla:** 「Chocola...」
Unable to make fun of anything, Vanilla could only look on with concern.
**Kashou:** 「......」
The pain from last night...
... pricked at my heart again.
I tilted the already-cooled coffee cup...
... as my emotions dulled, unimpeded by my judgement.
**Chocola:** 「Besides...」
**Chocola:** 「Besides, Chocola... wants to be with Master...」
Her usually always perky ears were drooping.
Chocola was speaking clearly under her own volition.
**Vanilla:** 「If Chocola is here, then I am too.」
**Vanilla:** 「... I think I want to be here too.」
Vanilla's usually blank expression did not change.
However, she showed me her strong determination.
**Chocola:** 「......」
**Vanilla:** 「Hmmm...」
"... I don't remember Chocola or Vanilla ever being this disobedient."
That thought stayed at the back of my mind.
But if I was going to be swayed by that...
... then I wouldn't have said this.
**Kashou:** 「... that. Understood?」
**Kashou:** 「Hmm?」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I'm with Royal Wood. Thank you very much for your business!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I'm here to deliver the tea set that you ordered.」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I'll bring it on into the bakery.」
**Tableware Seller:** 「This should be all the boxes.」
**Tableware Seller:** 「If everything looks to be in order, could you please sign this invoice?」
She smiled brightly and brought out the invoice along with a pen.
**Kashou:** 「Okay, let's see...」
I looked over the sales invoice I received once more.
**Kashou:** 「......」
**Kashou:** 「... Somehow, this doesn't look like what I ordered.」
**Tableware Seller:** 「... Huh, is that so?」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Are you saying that these... aren't the correct items?」
**Kashou:** 「No, the stuff I ordered is in here too, but...」
I looked over at the pile of boxes inside the bakery.
Inside of my tiny bakery was a mountain of boxes. A MOUNTAIN.
It was as if the inside of the bakery had become completely made of boxes.
**Kashou:** 「As you can see, we don't need this much tableware inside the bakery...」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I-I'm sorry! I'll check with the main office right away!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Could you give me a few moments?」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I'm sorry for the inconvenience...!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Because of an error on our part, it appears that another order got mixed in with yours...」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I imagine that you may be in need of these items right away, Mr. Minaduki...」
**Tableware Seller:** 「So if at all possible, if you would be able to accept this order...」
**Kashou:** 「Accept this order...」
**Kashou:** 「... Huh? From all this?」
The mountain of cardboard boxes towered over everything.
I was at a loss for words.
Every box was of equal size.
I wouldn't know what was inside each of them without opening them up.
On top of that, looking at the sales invoice, I could see that they all contained expensive tea sets and tableware.
And if I accepted it all, it would be a lot of work to deal with all the new items.
**Kashou:** 「Uhm, there's still things that need doing in advance of my bakery's opening, so I don't mind accepting these...」
**Kashou:** 「... but it's going to take a while to deal with all of this.」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Of course, I would be more than happy to help!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「I have to make it to my next delivery, after all...!」
**Kashou:** 「Look, you don't need to put all this pressure on me...」
From looks of it, it would take two hours or more...
But to have it redelivered would take double the effort, too...
**Kashou:** 「...... Hmm?」
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「Stare.」
**Kashou:** 「That's right, I have a lifeline!!」
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「Meow meow?! What is it?!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「You've really saved me, catgirls!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Thank you! Thank you oh so very much!」
**Tableware Seller:** 「Well then, I'll be on my way!」
**Kashou:** 「... Haah, I'm exhausted...」
I glanced at the tableware we had finished organizing...
... lowered myself into a chair and relaxed my shoulders.
**Chocola:** 「Master, here's some cold tea! Please enjoy it!」
**Kashou:** 「Thanks, Chocola. Don't mind if I do.」
I downed the cold tea in one gulp.
Somehow or another, the light meal tableware had arrived.
Soon, I really had to get the bakery ready for its opening.
... I did say I needed any help I could find.
And I really did need help this time--
**Kashou:** 「...... Hm?」
**Chocola:** 「Stare~ (Praise me praise me praise me praise me! ♪)」
... I could sense the "praise me" aura coming from Chocola.
She had a wide smile on her face and was in a ready stance to receive my approval.
**Kashou:** 「... Thanks. I couldn't have done it without you two.」
**Chocola:** 「Yay~! Vanilla, Master is praising us~!」
**Chocola:** 「Yay~! Yahoo~!!」
**Vanilla:** 「Yes, yes. It was worth it, watching from the shadows. You did well.」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola was helpful, right, Master? Right?」
**Chocola:** 「It's difficult for Master to work alone, after all~ ♪ Right, right?」
**Vanilla:** 「Yes, yes. Assistance from a catgirl is definitely effective.」
**Vanilla:** 「If we weren't here, I imagine you'd still be sorting boxes.」
**Kashou:** 「Hey, you two are getting a bit too close...」
They leaned forward towards me for emphasis.
**Kashou:** 「It is true that without you two around, this would have been a real problem...」
**Kashou:** 「... But that's a different issue than the one from before. You two have to go back home.」
**Kashou:** 「Besides, it's not like I could ask you two to work for me or anything, okay?」
**Chocola:** 「... Is that so... Chocola guesses it's no use then...」
Her shoulders drooped along with her ears and tail.
The enthusiasm she showed earlier had completely disappeared.
She sighed deeply and looked disheartened.
**Chocola:** 「... Since we're here anyways, Chocola guesses she'll go clean up...」
She trudged up to the second floor, still dejected.
**Kashou:** 「......」
Chocola isn't an idiot.
I knew she was pushing herself to be bright and full of energy.
But even so, this wasn't something I was going to easily change my mind about.
It was all the more with how much she cared for me.
**Vanilla:** 「Is it that much of a bother for us to be here, Master? Are we bad catgirls?」
She spoke quietly in her usual way.
Vanilla tilted her head as she asked that question.
**Kashou:** 「... You two aren't bad catgirls, and that's why I can't have you stay here.」
**Vanilla:** 「We can't stay even though we aren't bad catgirls?」
**Kashou:** 「It's because you two are good catgirls that I can't allow it.」
**Vanilla:** 「Hmmmm...?」
She blinked as she took in my words.
It was almost as if she was trying to peer inside my heart.
She stared directly at me, long and hard.
**Vanilla:** 「Humans are hard to understand. Catgirls do not understand such things.」
**Vanilla:** 「If we like a human, we want to be near them. At the very least, that's how I feel.」
**Kashou:** 「Vanilla...」
**Vanilla:** 「I will go check on Chocola.」
With those words, she went upstairs.
The sound of her small footsteps slowly disappeared and before long I couldn't hear them anymore.
**Kashou:** 「... "Humans are hard to understand", huh?」
Inside the bakery, now devoid of anyone but myself...
... I repeated those words she had just said to me.
**Kashou:** 「... Now that I think about it, that's a pretty inconsistent way of thinking, isn't it?」
*Cats do not understand that.*
Having heard that said aloud, I began to understand what it really meant.
**Kashou:** 「... It must be pretty nice to live the simple life of a catgirl, huh?」
I pondered as I looked at the name of the bakery affixed to the window.
With a bitter smile, I began to clean up the tea sets that had arrived earlier.
**Vanilla:** 「Huh, that takoyaki seller isn't here today.」
Just like yesterday, we took a walk through the park in the evening.
However, that food stand was nowhere to be found.
It just so happened that no one was home on the day I decided to take the two catgirls home.
I had also happened to leave the house key behind.
So to make good use of time, I went to do some shopping before Shigure got home.
**Chocola:** 「... Eh? Ah, s-sorry, Vanilla!」
**Chocola:** 「What was it called... catnip?」
**Vanilla:** 「That sounds about right.」
**Kashou:** 「That isn't the right word at all.」
**Kashou:** 「Chocola, if you're tired, why don't we rest a bit?」
**Chocola:** 「Ah, okay. Maybe a little bit...」
**Chocola:** 「... Ah, no, Chocola is fine. Sorry to worry you, Master.」
**Kashou:** 「... There's no need for you to apologize.」
She had a troubled smile on her face as she nodded.
It was pretty clear why she wasn't in good spirits.
That's why there was nothing I could really say to her.
**Kashou:** 「Well, there happens to be a bench over there, so why don't we rest a bit?」
**Vanilla:** 「In that case, I will go buy something to drink.」
**Kashou:** 「Ahh, thanks. Something for everyone, okay?」
**Vanilla:** 「Understood. Leave it to me.」
I handed Vanilla some change and offered the bench to Chocola.
**Chocola:** 「......」
The constant sea breeze rustled the trees in the park.
All that could be heard throughout the empty park were the quiet sounds of nature.
I silently sat down next to the disheartened Chocola.
Like the gently setting sun, time passed by slowly.
**Chocola:** 「... Chocola... will go home.」
Her voice was so quiet that I wasn't quite sure if I had heard her or not.
Even so, she answered clearly.
Without saying a word, I responded by gently rubbing Chocola's head.
**Chocola:** 「... Is it all right if Chocola calls you sometimes, Master?」
**Kashou:** 「Yeah.」
**Chocola:** 「... Would it be all right to go visit you as well, Master?」
**Kashou:** 「Yeah.」
**Chocola:** 「Master... Will you be sure to think about us every day...?」
**Chocola:** 「Is it all right for Chocola to... still call you Master... even if Chocola is far away from you?」
Her voice trembled as she frantically wiped away her tears.
She stifled her sobbing and her voice became strained.
She looked pained as she did her best to hold back her emotions, biting her lips.
I held back my irresponsible words that were on the brink of coming out with all my strength.
**Kashou:** 「... Yeah. Of course, I will.」
**Chocola:** 「Uu... uuu...! U-Uwahh...!! Master...!!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola is sorry...! Masterrr...!! Uuuwahh...!!」
I was frustrated at myself for saying nothing. I was empty.
I could only offer condolences that could not be put into words.
I rubbed Chocola's head as gently as I could.
**Chocola:** 「Sniffle... You really are kind, aren't you Master...?」
**Kashou:** 「... I don't really think I'm kind at all.」
**Chocola:** 「You said the same thing before, didn't you Master...」
**Kashou:** 「Before...?」
Chocola closed her eyes and smiled.
**Chocola:** 「Do you remember? When Chocola and Vanilla...」
**Chocola:** 「... were taken home by Master and Shigure-chan.」
**Kashou:** 「Ahh. Of course I remember that.」
... It was a cold day half a year ago.
Chocola and Vanilla were huddled together, crying by the side of the road.
They were still so young, they couldn't even speak yet.
It was that day that I embraced their small, cold bodies...
... and took them home with me.
There was no way I could simply forget that important day when our family grew.
**Kashou:** 「In the beginning, you two really couldn't get used to things at home.」
**Chocola:** 「We were scared back then because we were in an unfamiliar house with people and catgirls we didn't know...」
**Kashou:** 「You two wouldn't eat at all, which really worried Shigure.」
**Chocola:** 「Yes. We really did make her worry.」
I started to hear a tiny bit of laughter in her voice as we reminisced about the past.
**Chocola:** 「... Do you remember... when Chocola and Vanilla had a fever too...?」
**Kashou:** 「... Ahh, I definitely do remember that.」
It was a few days after we brought Chocola and Vanilla home.
At that point, they'd only occasionally drink some water.
And as always, they didn't really touch their food.
The combination of malnourishment and cold weather had really begun to weaken their bodies.
They both developed high fevers and were in pain.
**Chocola:** 「No one had realized it that night...」
**Chocola:** 「But we felt so much pain, anguish, and loneliness...」
**Chocola:** 「We couldn't speak or move our arms or legs at all...」
**Chocola:** 「All we could do was cry and cry as we kept hoping for someone -- anyone -- to come and save us...」
**Chocola:** 「And then...」
*It's all right. I'm with you two, so don't worry.*
**Chocola:** 「With your big, warm hands... you gently rubbed our heads, Master.」
**Chocola:** 「You kept saying "Don't worry, don't worry" as you stayed by our side...」
**Chocola:** 「... And continued to stroke and comfort both Chocola and Vanilla...」
**Chocola:** 「When morning came, you took us to the hospital. You were always, always by our side...」
**Chocola:** 「... We felt so anxious and helpless, it felt like it was all just lies to us.」
**Chocola:** 「... Back then, you said the same thing.」
**Chocola:** 「That you didn't think you were being kind.」
**Chocola:** 「... But if Master hadn't saved us, Chocola and Vanilla wouldn't be here now.」
**Chocola:** 「Back then, if Master wasn't by our side, we still wouldn't be able to trust anyone.」
**Chocola:** 「Thanks to Master, we were able to eat again.」
**Chocola:** 「We were able to become friends with Shigure-chan and everyone else.」
**Chocola:** 「... That's why, from that day forward, Master became Chocola's Master.」
**Chocola:** 「It was that day forward that Chocola began loving her kind Master, you know?」
I wished that her tear-filled eyes would not spill over.
Those tears were filled with anxiety, sadness, and happiness.
She smiled all she could before me.
**Chocola:** 「That's why when Chocola hears that Master won't be around anymore...」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola couldn't do anything else but want to go with Master...」
**Chocola:** 「So Chocola begged Shigure-chan.」
She said that with the faintest of smiles -- one that seemed as if would disappear at any moment.
Those words were so gentle and warm.
But there was also an undeniable sadness and emptiness mixed in with them.
**Kashou:** 「... Chocola.」
I was the one she was saying all this to.
Even so, the only thing I could say back to her was her name.
**Chocola:** 「Chocola guesses catgirls don't really understand when it comes to money and other complex things...」
**Chocola:** 「... Still.」
**Chocola:** 「No matter what, Chocola wants to be by Master's side...」
**Chocola:** 「When Master is having a tough time or is in trouble... somehow Chocola just knows.」
**Chocola:** 「... Chocola just somehow does.」
**Chocola:** 「Whether it's cleaning, doing the laundry, or cooking, Chocola will do anything to help...!」
**Chocola:** 「Even if Chocola can't do it properly right now, Chocola will absolutely make sure that she'll be able to do things right someday...!」
**Chocola:** 「... That's why.」
**Chocola:** 「That's why... would it be okay... to ask for one more favor...?」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola... wants to be with Master...」
Chocola voiced her feelings clearly once again...
... and barely kept her tears from overflowing.
*Chocola, if you could be with me--*
I was engulfed by my inner thoughts which were ready to overflow.
She yearned for me so earnestly.
For her to so innocently believe in me... There should be no reason for me to be against it.
That day, Chocola and Vanilla became an important part of my family.
As long as they were with me, the days would be bright and enjoyable.
... I was simply selfish for just leaving home like that.
I didn't want to get my dear family wrapped up in my selfishness...
... or have them experience any unnecessary hardship because of me.
*You two are important to me, after all--*
**Vanilla:** 「We are catgirls, so we're honest with ourselves.」
My inner conflict was disrupted by Vanilla.
Vanilla had returned at some point...
... and she looked straight at me as she sat at Chocola's side.
**Vanilla:** 「For me, as long as it's fun, I am fine being with Chocola.」
**Vanilla:** 「Even if there are hardships, I think I am fine being with Chocola.」
**Vanilla:** 「After all, it's much more lonely and painful when we can't be together.」
**Kashou:** 「... Vanilla.」
**Vanilla:** 「If we really love you then even if it's troublesome we want to be with you. That is a reason to want to be with you.」
**Vanilla:** 「Stuff like whether we'd be happy or not...」
**Vanilla:** 「Even though you're our Master, don't you think it's wrong for you to decide that?」
**Vanilla:** 「Besides, when a person important to us is in trouble, that's more reason for us to want to be by their side.」
**Vanilla:** 「We don't know what we can do, but...」
**Vanilla:** 「... In tough times, we can at least be by your side to cheer you up. That we can do.」
It was as if her gentle, warm, and soft smile...
... had become the setting sun.
These uncharacteristic words from Vanilla...
... deeply penetrated and seeped into my heart.
**Vanilla:** 「That is probably why Shigure let us follow you, Master.」
**Vanilla:** 「Since Shigure can't go with you, she asked us to go in her stead, Master.」
**Vanilla:** 「That is why, if Master really cares about us, then I believe we should be with you.」
There was not even the faintest bit of hesitation.
They were such honest and absolutely straightforward words.
*Who am I to dictate Chocola and Vanilla's happiness?*
Only those words continued to strongly resonate in my mind...
... which was otherwise empty.
**Chocola:** 「... Even if we lived a worry-free life, we would hate it if Master wasn't around.」
**Chocola:** 「No matter how difficult, Chocola wants to be together with Master.」
**Chocola:** 「That's why Chocola begs you to allow us to be by your side, Master.」
**Chocola:** 「This is where Chocola wants to be.」
She was on the verge of tears...
... but Chocola's face lit up.
They were nothing but absolutely pure, genuine words.
**Kashou:** 「... Humans really are at a loss for words when it comes to catgirls, huh?」
Saying "no" to their words...
... was not something I could bring myself to do.
**Chocola&Vanilla:** 「Master, does that mean...」
**Kashou:** 「It won't be like it was back at home. You can't just live here however you like, got it?」
**Chocola:** 「Yes! That won't be a problem!」
**Chocola:** 「Chocola is happy as long as Master is here with her!」
**Vanilla:** 「Well, well~ Master has finally surrendered.」
**Vanilla:** 「Sometimes people say they hate what they actually love, right?」
The dreary moment seemed to be blown away by her dazzling smile.
... Despite all this talk about family, perhaps I was the one that didn't really believe in it.
Thinking about all this from their perspective, it was very simple.
Although I thought it was all still so immature.
Perhaps catgirls were more human than humans were when it came to honesty.
**Kashou:** 「From here on out, we need to do our best all together.」
**Chocola:** 「Of course! ♪ Chocola is all right even if we don't have fatty tuna for dinner every night! Just occasionally is good enough!」
**Vanilla:** 「For meat, A4 grade is fine as long as it's Matsuzaka beef. Fatty meat is the best!」
**Kashou:** 「... Is that all you guys have been eating at home?!」
Even if the road ahead of us is uncertain...
I lovingly rubbed their heads, disheveling their hair.
**Kashou:** 「All right, why don't we head back to the shopping district then?」
**Chocola:** 「Eh? Why is that? Aren't you done with shopping already?」
**Kashou:** 「We have to go buy that shampoo you guys liked, don't we?」
**Vanilla:** 「Ohhh~ Master is so cool!」
**Vanilla:** 「While we're at it, let's buy some Matsuzaka beef.」
**Kashou:** 「Well, today is a celebration, so why not?」
**Chocola:** 「Yay~! A celebratory party!」
**Vanilla:** 「Master is so generous...! As expected of our Master...!」
**Kashou:** 「Just this once, okay?」
This was the beginning to a bright, new life...
... and together with the happy and high-spirited Chocola and Vanilla, we took the first steps towards it...
